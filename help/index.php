          <div>
            <p>Sorry about that. We try to find the closed approximation of your cool song playing on your device on the YouTube website. Sometimes we find a studio version, sometimes only a live version of that song, and in rare cases, we can’t find a match, so we don’t post a link. Try a different song if that happens. It’s fun to use and lets you share that common music experience immediately with your social media posse.</p>

          <h3>What audio and video formats does Songbird support?</h3>
          <div>

              WMA with Windows Media on Windows. AAC with FairPlay on Mac.
              Oh, and did you know about the video, too?

          <br>
          <h3>Where do I find the Songbird Source Code?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Songbird no longer maintains a public SVN server so you will need to download the current release source archive file directly from getsongbird.com.</p>
            <p>Point your browser to the<a href="http://getsongbird.com/desktop/"> Desktop</a> page and look for the source link right under the "Free For Mac" pink button.</p>
            <p>Click on that link and your browser will begin to download the latest source archive.  Happy coding!</p>

          <h3>My Iphone (Ipod/Ipad) doesn't show up in Songbird, why?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Oh, those happy Android phone owners! And unhappy Ipods, Iphones, Ipads users... Unfortunately we don't support sync with those any more.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>My device is not recognized by Songbird media player, why?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>First of all, let me ask you what device do you have? And have I mentioned that we do not support Iphones/Ipads/Ipods?
            Second of all, what is the OS on your computer? If you are on Mac, make sure you plug device in MSC (USB mode) you can specifically change connection settings in your device preferences. Windows users should be able to see their devices in both MSC and MTP connection modes.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>I am not able to download Songbird from your website. How can I get it?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>If you are not able to download the app from our website, there's a direct link for you:<br>
            For <a href="http://getsongbird.com/desktop/index.php?download=windows">Windows</a>
            For <a href="http://getsongbird.com/desktop/index.php?download=mac">Mac OS</a>
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>I updated Songbird and some of my favorite addons don't work any more. How can i have them work again?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>I assume those are community addons which were created by our great generous community supporters. And some of them are not updated to be compatible with the current Songbird version. We know that you love those unsupported addons, and we came up with a little trick on how to help you make them work again.
            <br>- Open a new tab and enter about:config in the address bar.
            <br>- Agree to the "I'll be careful!" warning.
            <br>- Right-click anywhere in the list, and select the "New Boolean" option.
            <br>- Enter extensions.checkCompatibility.2.2, as the name (or Whatever Songbird version you have: 2.1, 2.0) and set the value to False.
            <br>- Restart Songbird.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>I love my Songbird library and prefernces, and I would like to use it on another machine. Is that possible?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Yes! But it will only work if you copy your profile to machine with the same Operating System. Here's how to do it: You need to capture your Songbird profile first (this is where all your preferences, artwork, cache).
            <br>On Windows profile artwork and cache are stored in AppData\Local\Songbird2. Crash reports, add-ons, library db files, preferences and all kinds of other important files are stored in AppData\Roaming\Songbird2. Basically you need to capture both and remember which is which.
            <br>On Mac machines Songbird profile is ~/Library/Application Support/Songbird2/.
            <br>Once you captured those, transfer them to another machine with the same OS into corresponding directories. Make sure to keep the same string of numbers and letters (/********.default/).  Songbird won't recognize your library correctly if you modify the profile name.  Now open 'profiles.ini', located in the root Songbird2 folder, and adjust the "Path" field to read the string of letters and numbers that your profile is.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>My Songbird media player has been acting strange recently. This is annoying! I want it fully functional back again!</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Sorry that Songbird is misbehaving. It might happen because your Songbird profile got corrupt. But no worries, there's a way to fix that, too!
            <br>Win32: Start > Songbird > Songbird (Profile Manager)
            <br>MacOSX: Open Terminal (or other command-line application) and run the following commands, pressing return after each line :
            <br>• cd /Applications/Songbird.app/Contents/MacOS/
            <br>./songbird -p
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>Creating new profile didn't help, I would like to reinstall Songbird.</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Your app has been acting strangely, new profile didn't help it, and you decided to reinstall?
            <br>1.  Delete your profile via the Profile Manager, being sure to select the "Delete files" button.
            <br>2.  Uninstall Songbird using the Uninstaller.
            <br>3.  Delete C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/AppData/Local/Songbird2 and C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/AppData/Roaming/Songbird2 . Delete everything out of C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/AppData/Local/Temp and C:/Temp and C:/Windows/Temp .
            <br>4.  If you're still having issues, you can also go into regedit, search for Songbird registry key anf remove it (Software/Songbird) .
            <br>For Mac users: delete Songbird from your Applications directory.
            <br>And then install a preferred Songbird build :)
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>What is Watch Folders? How do I set it up?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Watch folders allow you to monitor the content of the specific directory. It will automatically add/remove tracks in your Songbird library, depending on the changes you perform in that certain directory.
            <br>You can set it up on the first run or while running the app:
            <br>1.  Go to Tools -> Options (Songbird -› Preferences on a Mac)
            <br>2.  Select the Media Importer tab -> Watch Folders.
            <br>3.  Choose which folder you want to watch for changes.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>I cannot find the way to listen to podcasts and bookmark web pages. Could you give me some guidance how to do that?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Unfortunately, we removed bookmarks and podcasts support since Songbird 1.7.3. Sorry about that!</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>How do I import my Itunes library to Songbird?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Easy as pie! You can either do it on the first run (screenshot)
            or select this preference in the app. Go to Preferences (or Options) -> Media Importer -> and enable Itunes import/export (screenshot).</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>How do I burn a CD in Songbird?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Unfortunately, Songbird doesn't have this functionality. You can only rip CD's using Songbird.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>How do I rip a CD in Songbird?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>You can easily rip your favorite CD's with Songbird. Just insert a CD, and it'll automatically show up Songbird, if the app is launched. Select a desired format (OGG, Flac on Mac), tracks and click on a magic "RIP" button.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>I am constantly getting a black square instead of my album artwork when i play music in Songbird. How can i fix this annoying issue?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>This issue was introduced in the recent Songbird release. While we are trying to fix this annoying bug, the only work around for you is to completely uninstall Mahtape addon.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>What is DLNA?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>DLNA stands for Digital Living Network Alliance, a collective trade organization started by Sony that is responsible for designing interoperability guidelines to enable sharing of digital media across multimedia devices. After that explanation, things get pretty technical. If you’re really curious, visit their Web Site at: http://www.dlna.org/</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>How to enable the Songbird DLNA Sharing Add-On:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>When Songbird is first installed on your computer, the DLNA Sharing Add-On is enabled by default.  If you wish to use the Sharing Add-On, then you’re all set to go. If do not wish to use it, simply click on the “Media Server” icon/text in the lower right hand corner of the main Songbird Desktop window and turn it off. Just know you can turn it on at anytime to connect your living room to Songbird for a media rich experience. Try it!</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>Library Scanning:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>When you add media to your Songbird library, the files need to be scanned by the Sharing Add-On so your DLNA compatible device will recognize them. If you have lots of cool tunes and videos, it can take a little while to scan them all.  Once scanning is completed, you should be good to go.  It’s best to just let Songbird do its thing while scanning so that all files get scanned in a single pass. If you have thousands of files, and we know some of you do, it’s going to take awhile.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>Why doesn’t my device recognize my files?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Not all DLNA enabled devices support all types of media file formats. You should refer to your device(s) user guide first to find out the correct media formats they support, and make sure all your files are in that compatible format for a smooth and successful streaming experience. If you files are not compatible, try to find a media utility on the Internet you can use to convert your files to the right formats your device will recognize.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>What is the difference between DLNA “Push” and “Pull” Control:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>“Push” control means you select the media you wish view on your DLNA enabled device in the main song bird library and drag it into the right hand Push Controller window pane after selecting your device from the device pull down menu. Then, once you’ve dragged over the music and/or video you want to check out, click the play button and that’s it.

            “Pull” control means you use the networking function on your DLNA enabled device to discover the Songbird library being shared when the Sharing Add On is running, and simply navigate to what you want to play. Simple. If you haven’t done that before and don’t know how, you better dig out the user manual for your device. If you lost the manual, I bet you can find it on the internet.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>Can I play a playlist with my DLNA Device?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Yup. Just create the playlist in the main Songbird library first, and then either “pull” it over from your device, or to “push” it, just drag and drop it into the selected device in the right hand push controller window pane after you’ve selected it from the device pull down and click that large “Play” button.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>Sometimes my files are grayed out in the DLNA push controller play queue, why?</h3>

            <p>Songbird tries to filter out files that your device can’t play. We based that upon the information gathered during the scanning process. If you have a favorite music track or video file you can’t play with your device, you’ll most likely have to convert it into a compatible file format your DLNA enabled device supports. Again, refer to your device’s user manual for a list of supported formats and find a file conversion utility on the internet and convert it. They, try again. It can be a complicated process, but we know you can do it. Good luck!</p>

          <h2>iOS</h2>
          <br>
          <h3>Minimum System Requirements:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>In order to install and run the Songbird.me App, you will need an Apple iOS device that supports iOS 5.1.1 or higher.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>Does the Songbird.me app play music?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Totally. We’ll play all your music stored on your device just like the iOS Music App. Let songbird become your go to music player. Voila!</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>Why should I log in?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>By logging into the Songbird.me App using your Facebook credentials, Songbird.me auto-magically personalizes your experience based on the bands and artists you love most. Additionally, logging in will then allow you to share great content from those artists and bands across your social networks. We think it’s pretty cool, hopefully you do too.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>Can I share this cool stuff to Twitter and Facebook?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>You most certainly can. We think it’s something we made very easy to do.  Check it out.
            <br>On iOS 6.x devices, setup your accounts in the iOS Settings App (the gray app icon with the three “gears” on it);  and tap on the “Facebook” option to set it up, and do the same for the “Twitter” option right above it. If you haven’t set up these accounts, then you won’t see them as options when you share stuff. Do it! Show your friends how smart you really are.
            <br>For iOS 5.1.1 devices, you can only share stuff to Facebook. Install the Facebook App from the iTunes store on your device and log in, or if you don’t want to use the Facebook app, that’s cool. Just log in to Facebook when you’re prompted by the Songbird.me app. Share stuff that matters to you.
            </p>

          <h3>The Songbird.me App won’t spam my Facebook account, right?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>No way! You control what you want to share and post to your Facebook Timeline and Twitter Feed. That’s it, no worries Kemosabe.</p>

          <br>
          <h3>How do I become a Top Fan?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>To start your top fan journey, you first need to follow some of your favorite artists and bands. Then, start to like and comment on their feed items to build your status ranking for that particular artist. Finally, if you get the chance to go see them live in concert, snap some pix using the Add+ feature and upload them to that band’s feed. The more you show that band or artist the love, you’ll eventually rise to the top of fandom and rule their world.  Once you become a Top Fan, we’ll send you a notification of your Top Fan achievement, and let you share that to your social media networks.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>Where does all this cool stuff come from?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>All artist content comes from a variety of well-known sources; including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Last.fm and Soundcloud.  We also support user-generated content using our “Add+” feature that let’s you join the party by uploading photos for any artist or band of your choice.  Check back on your followed artists and bands often to see what other users are uploading and contributing.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h3>What is Add+?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Go to a show and take pix of your fav artists and then upload them to that artist’s feed as found on Songbird.me website. We do the magic behind the scenes. Show the love for them and they will love you back. Really. They will. We promise. </p>
          </div>

          <h3>I shared one of my songs from the music player, but a link didn’t show up on my timeline post or Twitter feed. What happened?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Sorry about that. We try to find the closest approximation of that cool song playing on your device over at the YouTube website. Sometimes we find a studio version, sometimes only a live version of that same song. In rare cases, we can’t find a match. When that happens, then we won’t have a link to add to your post. It’s a bummer, we know, but it’s doesn’t happen very often.  Give it a try and share your favorite music with your social media posse!</p>

          <h3>Does Songbird.me support wireless streaming?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>You bet we do. Tap on the Airplay button in the music player and stream to your AppleTV.  In addition, setup an Airplay compatible server on your computer and stream to your heart’s content.
