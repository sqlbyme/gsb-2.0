			</p>
			<p>
			12.2 Notice. If you believe that your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and such infringement is hosted by POTI, please provide, pursuant to the DMCA, written notification via regular mail or via fax (not via e-mail or phone) of claimed copyright infringement to POTI’s Copyright Agent (contact information below).  The notice must include all of the following elements:

			(1) A physical or electronic signature of the owner, or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of the copyright interest that is alleged to have been infringed;

			(2) A description of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to be infringed and an identification of what content is infringing and that you request to be removed or disabled;

			(3) A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located in the Properties;

			(4) Information sufficient to permit POTI to contact you, such as your physical address, telephone number, and email address;

			(5)  A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the content identified in your notice in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

			(6) A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.

			Before you file such a notification, please carefully consider whether or not the use of the material at issue is protected by the “fair use” doctrine, as you could be liable for costs and attorneys’ fees should you file a takedown notice where there is no infringing use. If you are unsure whether a use of copyrighted material constitutes infringement, please contact an attorney. 
			</p>
			<p>
			12.3 Counter-Notification. If you believe access to your content was disabled or removed by POTI as a result of an improper copyright infringement notice, please provide, pursuant to the DMCA, written notification via regular mail or via fax (not via e-mail or phone) to POTI’s Copyright Agent (contact information below), which must include all of the following elements: 

			(1) A physical or electronic signature of the user;

			(2) Identification of the material that was removed from the Services and the location of the Service on which the material appeared before it was removed;

			(3) A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; 

			(4) Information sufficient to permit POTI to contact you, such as your physical address, telephone number, and email address; and 

			(5) A statement that you consent to jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district where you reside (or for San Francisco, California if you reside outside of the United Sates) and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under DMCA subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person. 

			Before you file such a counter-notification, please carefully consider whether or not the use of the copyrighted material at issue is infringing, as you could be liable for costs and attorneys’ fees in the event that a court determines your counter-notification misrepresented that the material was removed by mistake. If you are unsure whether use of the material at issue constitutes infringement, please contact an attorney.

			</p>
			<p>
			14.6. Waiver. The failure of POTI to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of POTI’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.

Except as expressly and specifically set forth in this these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by POTI shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor be legally binding unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of POTI.
